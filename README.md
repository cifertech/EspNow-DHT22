# EspNow-DHT22
Using the ESP32 board and the Wemos board with the ESP8266 chip, send the temperature values from the source of the ESp32 board to the Wemos board using the ESP-NOW protocol.

## What it DO!
In the DHT22 sensor data transmission project, one board will be the sender and the other the receiver. The ESP32 board will obtain the temperature and humidity values with the DHT22 sensor and send them to the Wemos board via the ESP-NOW protocol.


### Items needed
-ESP32
-Wemos
-DHT22

### Required libraries
-esp_now
-WiFi

## Conclusion
A variety of sensors are designed and manufactured to measure temperature and humidity. Each has a different range and sensitivity. The DHT22 sensor is one of the best sensors for measuring temperature and humidity. These sensors consist of two parts, capacitive humidity and a heat resistor. There is also an analog-to-digital converter unit in the DHT22, which generates digital output. With the help of this converter, the user can use it in microcontrollers to read values.
